# Statistics

### **1) Correlation Coefficient**  
**What is it?**  
- A correlation coefficient is a number that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It is represented by the letter \(r\)
**What does it mean?**
- Perfect positive correlation
When one variable increases, the other increases as well. The correlation coefficient is +1.
-Zero correlation
There is no relationship between the variables. The correlation coefficient is 0.
-Perfect negative correlation
When one variable increases, the other decreases. The correlation coefficient is -1.

**Example 1: Calculate the correlation coefficient \(r\)**  
Suppose we have the following data:  

| X (Hours Studied) | Y (Marks Obtained) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2                  | 20                |
| 4                  | 40                |
| 6                  | 60                |
| 8                  | 80                |

### **2) Regression Analysis**  

**What is Regression?**  
- Regression finds the line that best fits data and predicts one variable based on another.  

**Example 2: Predict Marks Using Regression Line**  
Suppose we have the same data:  

| X (Hours Studied) | Y (Marks Obtained) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2                  | 20                |
| 4                  | 40                |
| 6                  | 60                |
| 8                  | 80                |
