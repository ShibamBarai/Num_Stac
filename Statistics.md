# Statistics

### **1) Correlation Coefficient**  
**What is it?**  
- A correlation coefficient is a number that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It is represented by the letter \(r\)
**What does it mean?**
- Perfect positive correlation
When one variable increases, the other increases as well. The correlation coefficient is +1.
-Zero correlation
There is no relationship between the variables. The correlation coefficient is 0.
-Perfect negative correlation
When one variable increases, the other decreases. The correlation coefficient is -1.

**Example 1: Calculate the correlation coefficient \(r\)**  
Suppose we have the following data:  

| X (Hours Studied) | Y (Marks Obtained) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2                  | 20                |
| 4                  | 40                |
| 6                  | 60                |
| 8                  | 80                |

### **2) Regression Analysis**  

**What is Regression?**  
- Regression finds the line that best fits data and predicts one variable based on another.  

**Example 2: Predict Marks Using Regression Line**  
Suppose we have the same data:  

| X (Hours Studied) | Y (Marks Obtained) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2                  | 20                |
| 4                  | 40                |
| 6                  | 60                |
| 8                  | 80                |

#### **Mode (Most Frequent Value)**  
**Definition:**  
- The value that appears most often in the dataset.  

**Example 1:**  
Data: 10, 20, 20, 30, 40.  
Mode = 20 (appears twice).  

**Example 2 (No Mode):**  
Data: 10, 20, 30, 40.  
Mode = None (no repeating values).  

**Example 3 (Multiple Modes):**  
Data: 10, 20, 20, 30, 30, 40.  
Mode = 20 and 30.

### **4) Measures of Skewness and Kurtosis**

#### **Definition**  
Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution:  
- A perfectly symmetrical distribution has a skewness of **0**.  
- Skewness indicates whether data values are more concentrated on one side of the mean.

---

#### **Types of Skewness**  
1. **Right Skew (Positive Skew)**:  
   - Tail is longer on the right.  
   - Mean > Median > Mode.  
   - Example: Income distribution (a few people earn significantly more than the average).

2. **Left Skew (Negative Skew)**:  
   - Tail is longer on the left.  
   - Mean < Median < Mode.  
   - Example: Exam scores (most students score high, with a few low scores).  

3. **Zero Skew (Symmetrical)**:  
   - Both sides of the mean are mirror images.  
   - Mean = Median = Mode.  
   - Example: Perfectly normal distribution.

### **2. Kurtosis**

#### **Definition**  
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of a distribution:  
- High kurtosis indicates heavy tails (more outliers).  
- Low kurtosis indicates light tails (fewer outliers).

---

#### **Types of Kurtosis**  
1. **Leptokurtic (Kurtosis > 3):**  
   - More peaked than a normal distribution.  
   - Heavy tails (more extreme outliers).  
   - Example: Stock market returns.

2. **Mesokurtic (Kurtosis = 3):**  
   - Similar to a normal distribution.  
   - Moderate tails.  
   - Example: Heights of people.

3. **Platykurtic (Kurtosis < 3):**  
   - Flatter than a normal distribution.  
   - Light tails (fewer extreme outliers).  
   - Example: Uniform distribution.

### **5) Normal Probability (Dice, Cards Problems)**  

#### **What is Normal Probability?**  
- It deals with events that follow a **bell-shaped curve**, called the **normal distribution**.  
- Most data clusters around the mean, with fewer data points appearing as you move away from it.

**Key Features:**  
1. Symmetrical around the mean.  
2. Mean = Median = Mode.  
3. Total area under the curve = 1 (or 100%).
